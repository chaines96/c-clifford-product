# Clifford Algebras and the Clifford Product Calculator
Clifford algebras are a type of algebra over an *n*-dimensional vector space which may allow the square of a vector to be equivalent to a specific real number. Among other reasons, they are of interest because they can be used to generalize complex numbers, quaternions and Pauli Spin Matrices. Elements of Clifford algebras are *multivectors* in which every element can be expressed as a sum of *k blades* which are multiples of a finite amount of basis vectors e<sub>1</sub>e<sub>2</sub>...e<sub>i</sub>. (These include scalars which are not multiplied by any basis vectors at all.) The Clifford product of two multivectors are defined to be associative and to be distributive over addition.

This calculator uses the *geometric product* with *Euclidean metric* in which, for all *i*, e<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup> = +1. In this algebra, the product of basis vectors is anti-commutative, meaning that e<sub>i</sub>e<sub>j</sub> = -e<sub>j</sub>e<sub>i</sub> for all i,j < n and i =/= j. This, combined with the associative and distributive properties, allow us to define the clifford product of two multivectors more generally.

# Using the Clifford Product Calculator
This calculator operates in an interactive session which asks for inputs to specify the dimension and coefficients of the two input multivectors. To use it, navigate to the program director, run:
```
make
.\c-clifford-product
```

# My Implementation
Each coefficient uses double precision floats to represent coefficients in the real numbers. Each multivector of an n dimensional vector space in is represented by an array of size 2<sup>n</sup> where the i-th bit of a number is set to 1 if vector i appears in the clifford product. The program then uses a bitwise exclusive or operation on the array index to represent parallel basis vectors being equal to 1, and then checks how many basis vectors are between in the highest index in the left term and the lowest index of the right. It then flips the coefficient's sign if the number is odd.

# Background
The tensor product of two vector spaces associates vectors in each space with a bilinear map to a "tensor space". i.e. for spaces A and B, the tensor product A $\otimes$ B maps each a $\in$ A, b $\in$ B to a $\otimes$ b $\in$ A $\otimes$ B. For all constants c, (ca) $\otimes$ b = c (a $\otimes\$ b). Given basis vectors e<sub>1</sub>,e<sub>2</sub>,...e<sub>i</sub>, the space A $\otimes$ B has basis *multivectors* e<sub>1</sub>, e<sub>2</sub>, e<sub>1</sub> $\otimes$ e<sub>2</sub> ... 

A Clifford Algebra of a given **quadratic form** Q(v) on a **vector space** *V* is the quotient algebra of the tensor algebra T(V) divided by the ideal generated by Q(V). If Q(V) = 0, this algebra becomes the exterior algebra with its product being known as the *wedge product* using the symbol "^". The property of Q(V) = 0 is equivalent to the property w ^ v = - v ^ w for all multivectors v,w. (This is different from our geometric algebra, in which only *perpendicular* multivectors are anti-commutative in general.) 

The Clifford product of two multivectors can be broken up into symmetric and antisymmetric components. For example, in our geomtric algebra with Euclidean metric, the product of vectors v, w are equal to v.w + v ^ w.

# Future Prospects
Right now, this program only uses the quadratic form e<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup> = +1 for basis vector e<sub>i</sub>. Support for more quadratic forms could be added in the future!
