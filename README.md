# Clifford Product Calculator

A small program in C which computes the geometric product of two multivectors with a specified dimension and bilinear form. Simply use the makefile and run the c-clifford-product executable for an interactive session.

For the time being, this program only uses the bilinear form e<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup> = 1 for basis vector e_i. Support for more bilinear forms could be added in the future!
